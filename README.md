# freeking

Note: The code quality of this right now is very poor, rushing through things as this is just a hobby project.

freeking is an open source reimplementation of [Kingpin: Life of Crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingpin:_Life_of_Crime)
written in modern C++ and modern OpenGL.

You still need to have the original game assets in order to use this.
